# Python - Variable Annotations

This project focuses on understanding and implementing type annotations in Python, a powerful feature that helps specify the types of variables, function signatures, and return values.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Use type annotations in Python 3.
- Specify function signatures and variable types.
- Understand and apply duck typing.
- Validate your code with `mypy`.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Basic Annotations - Add**: Implement a function `add` that takes two floats and returns their sum.
2. **Basic Annotations - Concat**: Create a function `concat` that concatenates two strings.
3. **Basic Annotations - Floor**: Write a function `floor` that returns the floor of a float.
4. **Basic Annotations - To String**: Implement `to_str` to convert a float to its string representation.
5. **Define Variables**: Annotate and define variables such as an integer, float, boolean, and string.
6. **Complex Types - List of Floats**: Create a function `sum_list` that sums a list of floats.
7. **Complex Types - Mixed List**: Implement `sum_mixed_list` to sum a list containing both integers and floats.
8. **Complex Types - String and Int/Float to Tuple**: Write a function `to_kv` that returns a tuple with a string and the square of a number.
9. **Complex Types - Functions**: Create a function `make_multiplier` that returns a multiplier function.
10. **Let's Duck Type an Iterable Object**: Annotate the `element_length` function that returns a list of tuples with an element and its length.

## Repository Structure

- **GitHub Repository**: `alx-backend-python`
- **Project Directory**: `0x00-python_variable_annotations`
- **Mandatory Files**: Each task's corresponding Python file (e.g., `0-add.py`, `1-concat.py`, etc.).

## Requirements

- Code must be written in Python 3.7 and adhere to `pycodestyle`.
- Each file must include appropriate documentation.
- The `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project.

Happy coding!üòÅüòÅ
